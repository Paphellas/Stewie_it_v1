**Stewie_it v1** is an experimental automation project inspired by a viral Instagram trend where Stewie and Peter Griffin humorously explain coding topics over gameplay footage. This project automates the assembly of these videos by combining user-provided scripts, AI-scraped voices, character images, and gameplay backgrounds, then sending them to the user.

> ⚠️ This is an experimental project created for fun and educational purposes. It uses techniques like scraping voices and rotating IPs via AWS EC2.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Script Input
Users provide scripts that outline the coding topics. The project processes these scripts to generate voiceovers and visuals.

### 2. AI Voice Generation
The project uses AI to generate voices for Stewie and Peter. It scrapes voice samples from various sources to create a natural-sounding narration.

### 3. Image and Gameplay Assembly
The project combines character images with gameplay footage. It overlays the images onto the gameplay to create an engaging viewing experience.

### 4. Output Delivery
Once the video is assembled, it is sent to the user. Users can then share or upload the video to their preferred platforms.
